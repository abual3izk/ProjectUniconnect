            <section id="why" class="card">
                <h2>Why We Built UniConnect</h2>
                <p>We developed this system to address three major gaps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Weak graduate tracking:</strong><br>
                        Universities struggle to obtain accurate and up-to-date information
                        about the employment status of their graduates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For graduates – communication issues:</strong><br>
                        Graduates often lack an official and organized channel to request
                        services or follow up on post-graduation matters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>For employers – limited connection with universities:</strong><br>
                        Companies face difficulties sharing feedback, verifying certificates,
                        or sending job and internship requests.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>General Objective of the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    The main objective of the project is to build a unified platform that
                    connects graduates, employers, and the university in a single integrated
                    system.
                </p>
                <p>The platform aims to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Centralize data instead of using scattered tools.</li>
                    <li>Improve graduate tracking and employment visibility.</li>
                    <li>Provide an official communication channel for alumni.</li>
                    <li>
                        Help the university enhance its academic programs based on employer
                        feedback.
                    </li>
                    <li>Streamline hiring, verification, and service requests.</li>
                </ul>
